It was designed to be hosted inside a Seed Box, a remote server used to download and share content through the Internet. \r\nSeedBoxer was created to work with downloads managers like rtorrent, utorrent, trasmission. This managers need to be configured to use watch, in progress and complete folders.\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer is based in two main features, the Mule which main purpose is distribute content to the user, and Sources which filter the user content from sources (RSSs), put them to download (download manager) and enqueue.\r\n\r\nThe Mule is a process that basically copy the downloaded content in the Seed Box to an user transport account. When the download to an user transport account was finished, a set of post actions and notifications will be executed depending on user configuration. The Mule manage the user downloads with a queue, each user has a download queue (FIFO).\r\n\r\n### Transport\r\n*   FTP\r\n*   Dropbox (coming)\r\n*   Google Drive (coming)\r\n*   Socket (SeedBoxer client) (coming)\r\n\r\n### Post Actions\r\n*   SSH send command\r\n\r\n### Notification\r\n*   Email\r\n*   C2DM (Android Push Notification)\r\n\r\nSources is a process that periodically scan a set of sources (RSSs) and filter the entries depending on users filters. A user can configure its owm filters based on types of content: TVShows, Movies, XBOX Games, etc. Each content has its owm properties, like TVShow that can be filtered by title, quality, episode or season.\r\n\r\n### Type of Content\r\n*   TVShow\r\n*   Movie (coming)\r\n*   XBOX Game (coming)\r\n\r\n### 3rd Party Integration\r\n*   IMDB - Personalized list (coming)\r\n*   The TVDB - Favourites TVShows (coming)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n*   Java version 1.6+\r\n*   MySQL Server version 5.1+\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Create Database\r\n\r\nCreate a MySQL database with name *seedboxer* and create its schema with the file [seedboxer_schema.sql] (https://github.com/seedboxer/seedboxer/blob/master/sql/seedboxer_schema.sql)\r\n\r\n### Deploy\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer can be deploy as standalone or inside a Java web application container like Tomcat. If you want to deploy it as web application, simple copy the SeedBoxer WAR file to your Tomcat webapps folder and set the variable *seedboxer.config.path=/etc/seedboxer* to the setup.sh inside Tomcat conf folder.\r\n\r\nOtherwise go to the project [SeedBoxer Standalone](https://github.com/seedboxer/seedboxer-standalone) to see further information.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe configuration file of SeedBoxer is in */etc/seedboxer/seedboxer.properties*.\r\n\r\nThe log file is in */var/log/seedboxer/seedboxer.log*.\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer only support user configuration via values in database.\r\n\r\n#### New user\r\n```mysql\r\nINSERT INTO `users` (`username`, `password`) VALUES ('username', MD5('password'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### User properties\r\n```mysql\r\nINSERT INTO `configurations` (`user_id`, `name`, `value`) VALUES ('id_user', 'prop_name', 'prop_value');\r\n```\r\n\r\nProperties names:\r\n*   proeasy_ftp_username\r\n*   proeasy_ftp_password\r\n*   proeasy_ftp_url\r\n*   proeasy_ftp_remoteDir\r\n*   proeasy_notification_email_email\r\n*   proeasy_ssh_cmd\r\n*   proeasy_ssh_url\r\n*   proeasy_ssh_username\r\n*   proeasy_ssh_password\r\n*   proeasy_notification_email\r\n*   proeasy_notification_c2dm\r\n\r\n#### New Feed\r\n```mysql\r\nINSERT INTO `feeds` (`url`) VALUES ('http://feedserver/feed.xml');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer offers access to that corpus of data, via APIs. Each API represents a facet of SeedBoxer, and allows developers to build upon and extend their applications in new and creative ways. It's important to note that the SeedBoxer APIs are constantly evolving.\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer expose its APIs via RESTful services, each API is accesible under the url *http://host/webservices*\r\n\r\n#### Status\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Resource</th><th>Params</th><th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET status</td><td>username</td><td>Show the download status for the given user</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### Downloads\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Resource</th><th>Params</th><th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET downloads/list</td><td>username</td><td>List all available downloads on the server</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET downloads/put</td><td>username,downloadName</td><td>Enqueue a download for the user</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET downloads/delete</td><td>username,downloadId</td><td>Delete a user download from the queue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET downloads/queue</td><td>username</td><td>Show the queue of the given user</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### C2DM\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Resource</th><th>Params</th><th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET registerDevice</td><td>username,deviceId,registrationId</td><td>Register a Android device to receive notifications</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### Torrents\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Resource</th><th>Params</th><th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>GET torrents/add</td><td>username,file</td><td>Add a torrent to watch directory and enqueue the download for the user</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nSeedBoxer is the work of:\r\n*   [Jorge Davison (jdavisonc)](http://github.com/jdavisonc)\r\n*   [Farid Elias (The-Sultan)](http://github.com/the-sultan)\r\n\r\nFor full list of contributors see the [CONTRIBUTORS]  (https://github.com/seedboxer/seedboxer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) file.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any issue or feature request with/for SeedBoxer, please add an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/seedboxer/seedboxer/issues) or fork the project and send a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 SeedBoxer Team.\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
